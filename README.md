# Vanadite Post

A secure and fast chat & groups app.


## How does it work?
When you use the app for the first time, you will need to login or sign up (when creating an account, make sure to click sign up and then login).
When you are in the main app, you will be granted to a form asking for a Publick key and a Private key and there are two options, either join a space or create a space (when creating a space you have to click create space and then click enter space.).
When you are in the main chat room you can send messages and invite others by giving them the public and private key (only share the keys if you have permission to do so).
## Thats it!
After all of that you have finally created a vanadite post space group! Share you groups with your friends and others!
